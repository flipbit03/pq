"""A task child must not use the parent worker's database connections, and
must close its own before it exits.

The worker forks a child per task, and the child inherits the parent's
SQLAlchemy engine: its pool holds the sockets the parent claims on. A handler
that reaches the application's ``PQ`` instance (to enqueue a follow-up task,
say) checks out one of those connections, and two processes then speak on one
Postgres session.

Over TLS one query from the child is enough: it advances the session's record
sequence numbers in the child's copy of the SSL state only, and the parent's
next record is rejected (``bad record mac`` / ``decryption failed``). Over a
plain socket the damage needs overlap: the parent's query queues behind the
child's, and whichever process reads first gets the other's result.

A child that opens connections of its own ends with ``os._exit()``, which skips
interpreter cleanup: unless pq closes them first, Postgres sees each one drop
without a terminate message.
